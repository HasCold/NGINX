This is the tree structure

main block -->>  1. username
        |        2. PID
        |        3. log location
        |        4. No. of worker process
        |
        |----->> Events Block -->>  1. No. of connection per worker process
        |        
        |
        |
        |----->> Stream Block -->> 1. TCP / UDP (Settings of layer 3 and 4 of OSI/)                             
        |        
        |
        |
        |----->> HTTP Block (Imp Block) --->> 1. server block = Can make the virtual servers or virtual host
                                                    |
                                                    |---->> location block = Routing the URL

                                              2. upstream block = upstream block is mainly used in when doing the reverse proxy + load balancing 




The TCP/IP model has four layers:

1 Network Interface (or Link) Layer:
Handles physical hardware and protocols to establish a network connection.
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

2. Internet Layer:
Responsible for logical addressing and routing.
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

3. Transport Layer:
Provides end-to-end communication services for applications.
Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

4. Application Layer:
Contains protocols and services for network applications.
Examples: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
