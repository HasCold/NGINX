The TCP/IP model has four layers:

1 Network Interface (or Link) Layer:
Handles physical hardware and protocols to establish a network connection.
Examples: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

2. Internet Layer:
Responsible for logical addressing and routing.
Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

3. Transport Layer:
Provides end-to-end communication services for applications.
Examples: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

4. Application Layer:
Contains protocols and services for network applications.
Examples: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
